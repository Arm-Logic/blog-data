# Klaviyo Pricing: A Comprehensive Guide to Email Marketing Costs

Klaviyo is a powerful email marketing platform that helps businesses drive sales and engage with their customers through targeted email campaigns. If you're considering using Klaviyo for your email marketing needs, it's essential to understand the pricing structure to determine the cost implications for your business. In this blog post, we'll provide a comprehensive guide to Klaviyo pricing.

## Pricing Tiers

Klaviyo offers a tiered pricing structure based on the number of contacts in your email list. The pricing tiers determine the features available to you and the monthly subscription cost. Let's explore the different pricing tiers Klaviyo offers:

1. **Free Tier**: Klaviyo offers a free plan for businesses with up to 250 contacts. The free plan includes basic features like email campaigns, signup forms, reports, and analytics. It's a great option for small businesses or those just starting with email marketing.

2. **Pricing Tiers**: For businesses with larger contact lists or those requiring more advanced features, Klaviyo offers pricing tiers based on the number of contacts. The pricing tiers start from 251 contacts and increase in increments of 500 contacts, 1,000 contacts, 2,500 contacts, and so on. As your contact list grows, you'll move up to higher pricing tiers.

## Pricing Factors

Several factors contribute to the cost of using Klaviyo beyond the number of contacts. It's essential to consider these factors to get a complete understanding of Klaviyo's pricing:

1. **Contacts**: The number of contacts in your email list is the primary driver of pricing. As your contact list grows, you'll move up to higher pricing tiers, which may result in increased costs.

2. **Email Sends**: Klaviyo pricing is also based on the number of emails you send each month. Each pricing tier has a limit on the maximum number of email sends allowed. If you exceed this limit, additional charges may apply.

3. **Advanced Features**: Klaviyo offers advanced features and capabilities that may require additional costs. These features include SMS marketing, integrations with third-party apps, advanced automation workflows, and more. Some of these features may be available as add-ons or require a higher pricing tier.

4. **Additional Services**: Klaviyo also offers additional services like email template design, email deliverability consulting, and dedicated account management. These services come at an additional cost and can be beneficial for businesses requiring extra assistance and support.

5. **SMS Marketing**: Klaviyo's SMS marketing feature is an additional cost on top of the standard email pricing. The cost for SMS marketing varies based on factors like the number of SMS sends and the country you're sending to.

## Pricing Transparency

One of the advantages of Klaviyo's pricing is its transparency. Klaviyo provides a pricing calculator on their website that allows you to estimate your monthly costs based on your contact list size and the number of email sends. This helps you understand the pricing structure and make informed decisions.

Additionally, Klaviyo offers a 14-day free trial that allows you to explore the platform's features and functionality without any financial commitment. It's an excellent opportunity to test the platform and evaluate if it aligns with your business needs.

## Conclusion

Understanding Klaviyo's pricing structure is crucial for businesses considering this email marketing platform. The pricing tiers based on the number of contacts, additional factors like email sends and advanced features, and the transparency of pricing contribute to the overall cost.

Evaluate your business requirements, the size of your contact list, and the features you need to determine the appropriate pricing tier. Take advantage of Klaviyo's free trial to explore the platform and assess its suitability for your email marketing needs.
